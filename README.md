The website design has some pretty nice Parallax effects.
The css folder has many files. I have used css preprocessor SASS for the project which compiles into a css file called style.css.
I have also used normalize and skeleton frameworks whose css and scss files(which are imported in the style.sass ) are present inside the css folder.
People comfortable with SASS, may find the normalize.scss, skeleton.scss and the layout1.scss files imported in the style.sass.

People not comfortable with SASS may find the layout of the web page in the style.css from Line 859 onwards.
